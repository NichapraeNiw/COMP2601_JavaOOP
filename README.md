# COMP2601_JavaOOP
This Java code represents a simple console-based menu-driven program and adheres to several pratices of Java OOP such as lambda, Streams and Filter, GUI, design patterns, and concurrency. The Main class will show the following screen and call the chosen method as listed; then the menu appears again and repeats until the user types 5 to quit:

**Type 1** for GUI                   // displays CountryList's window

**Type 2** for Streams and Filters   // calls CountryProcessor class's processCountries() method

**Type 3** for Design Patterns       // calls Tester class's test() method

**Type 4** for Concurrency           // calls concurrentMain()

**Type 5** to Quit                   // ends the program (do not call System.exit(); just end the menu loop)
